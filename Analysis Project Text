# Section 1

## Subsection 1.1
By looking at the history of the sport of sailboat racing during 1905 and 1906 in Egypt, one can learn several things about the culture. I looked for all sections throughout the 1905 and 1906 issues of the Egyptian
Gazette thta mentioned the word "regatta". This brought back about 30 results in different issues, mostly in 1905. sailboat racing seemed to have been a popular recreational sport since it is in the newspaper almost every
week during the summer. The regatta section occured mostly in the third page of the issue and was under the sports section. The posts would vary from results to handicapping protocol for the upcoming regatta.

I have experince racing sailboats and am apart of the sailing team at Florida State. The handicap system is used today for racing against different types of sailboats. It adjusts your elapsed time to make faster boats and slower boats
 equal for a fair race. I think that the handicapping described in the Gazette is close to the same as the type we have today. The start times that are listed are the time of day that each boat starts the race and the finish time
 is the time of day that the boat finishes.

 As viewers can see, the start times vary for each boat. The table also lists the Captains name, in which you can sometimes find a Prince, or Lieutinents steering boats in the races. This and the fact that the scoring is
 consistently in the paper, leads me to believe the races were for upper class citizens. In this section of the newspaper you can see that the Khedive was coming to visit the yacht club, furthering the assumption that
 the racers were upper class.

 The article says how the Khedive enjoyed watching the racing. This articke also mentions the Rowing club which may have been apart of the yacht club. After inputing the data from several regattas into excel, I was able
 to create graphs that showed the amount of races as well as the average of each boats finishes. This data was mostly found in the summer months of 1905 issues. I found that most of the same boats particpated in every
  regatta, but the captain name would change every now and then. It was difficult to find some of the scoring articles since some people from the 1905 issues never uploading their page images and some were tables that
  were updated by OCR. It looks like they did as many as 20 regattas throughout the summer season. It is also interesting that as time passes, the race directors would update the handicaps and the finish times would
  get closer together.
